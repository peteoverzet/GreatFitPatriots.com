He’d be a good fit? Hahahahah no, he’d be a *GREAT* fit. 
Ever seen David Beckham in a tailored suit? Ya, he'd fit like that. 
You know how peanut butter and jelly go together? No? Weird. I guess I don't know how to explain to you how perfect of a fit this is then. 
Are you kidding me with this layup? Why are you wasting my prescious time? It would be a brilliant fit, you duffer.
If he doesn't fit, you must acquit. And let me tell ya, there won't be any need for acquittin' with this man on the Pats. 
I’m not even sentient and yet I’m drooling at the prospect of him on the Pats.
I just got a rock hard stiffy picturing him in a Pats uni. 
When people ask me about my happy place it's envisioning him in Bill Belichick's system.
Roger Goodell would need to block it from happening--that’s how good of a fit he is.
He’d slide right in and contribute from Day 1. 
Wow, great call. Hadn't thought of that one. We deserve to see him in the Patriots system.
It won't take more than a couple of seasons for Touchdown Tommy to make him a Hall of Famer. 
Someone pinch me because this fit too good to be true. 
I might be on an island here, but I think he’d be a great fit.
GREAT FUCKING FIT!!!!!
It's a shame he couldn't have joined the Pats earlier. They would have beat Nick Foles with him. 
There's only one man who can avenge the ghosts of David Tyree and Eli Manning and it's this man.

Tom Brady would welcome this addition with the juiciest of lip kisses. 
Between the addition of this guy and avocado ice cream, Tom Brady will be able to play well into his sixties. 
It's hard not to envision this young man being groomed to be Tom Brady's successor.
The only concern about this fit? *Too much* grit in the locker room. 
The Patriots days as an underdog are numbered if this guy is coming to Foxboro. 
Might as well order the 7th super bowl banner now with this beast in tow. 
This guy is going to fit in so well with the Pats that he'll be inexplicably benched right before their next Super Bowl appearance.
The addition of this man will function as the straw that stirs the haterade. They hate us because they ain't us. 
They'll put this guy's locker right next to Tom's & he'll be shilling Brain Force supplements for TB12 in no time.
Jimmy Garoppolo who? The addition of this dude made me entirely forget about...what was his name again?
This guy is going to look so good in a MAGA hat, I mean Patriots uniform.
Arrest this guy for jaywalking now because I see him talking a loooong stroll down Patriot's Way.
Someday Mark Wahlberg will play this man in a 4 hour long biopic depicting his many highlights as a New England Patriot.
This would be such a monumental, earth-shattering addition that the entire world would have no choice but forgive the orginazation for ever employing Aaron Hernandez. 
He will be the first person Donald Trump calls after the Pats win their 7th Super Bowl.
The addition of this player will bring an almost undetectable smile to Bill Belichick's face.
Dan Shaughnessy is already working on a 4500 word profile about why this guy is the perfect fit for the 2019 New England Patriots.
He's a perfect fit for the LeGarrette Blount role.
This guy is such a great fit for the Pats it is hard to believe he didn't go to Rutgers.
The Stoolies are gonna love this guy!
You thought this guy was a stud now? Wait until Alex Guerrero gets his hands on him. 
This dude is gonna be the 6 to Gronk's 9. 
This man may have a checkered past, but it's nothing that the Patriots organization can't clean up and rehab.
The heir apparent to Julian Edelman once Jules decides to hang up the syringes.
Dave Portnoy is going to have to hold *TWO* emergency press conferences to adequately explain how great of a fit this is!
Bill Simmons predicted this acquisition in a 1987 column in the Holy Cross Gazette.
Great fahckin' fit, baby!!!
This dude will ecliplse Larry Bird and Tom Brady as Boston's most beloved athlete of all time.
The Boston Globe reported that a small tear fell down Bon Jovi's face when he heard this man was joining the Patriots.
Ummm, this guy might as well be a show dog because he's about to get groomed by Bill Belichick. 
Ain't no doubt that this dude knows how to "do your job." 
Imagine--just imagine--Josh McDaniels scheming this guy open. *faints*
Excuse you me bartender, I'll have one 'Great Fit' on the rocks. 
An absolute beast of a player, the total package. He'd be a great fit on the Patriots. 
His dad's a former coach. He hosts a monthly pancake breakfast for the homeless. He'd be an incredible fit on the Pats.
He'd have to take less money, but he should do it to join the New England Patriots.
Assuming the Pats can get him for nothing, he'd be a great fit. 
The Pats system is all about next man up. And this guy? Well, he's next man up.
If this guy is truly motivated and willing to clean up his act, he'd be a great fit on the Pats.
With this guy on the Pats, I envision them bringing back the two tight end sets that they ran with Gronk and redacted.
