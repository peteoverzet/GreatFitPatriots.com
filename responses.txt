He’d be a good fit? No, he’d be a *great* fit. 
They’d be an incredible fit.
You know how peanut butter and jelly go together? It’d be like that...but better. 
Are you kidding? It would be a brilliant fit.
They’d fit like a fucking glove. 
I’m not even sentient and yet I’m drooling at the prospect of him on the Pats.
I don’t even have a penis but I just got a stiffy picturing them in a Pats uni. 
I’m not even a human but I’m hard as a rock imagining them in a Bill Belichick system.
Roger Goodell would need to shut it down--that’s how good of a fit it is.
They’d slide right in and contribute, duh.
Wow, great call. We deserve to see them in the Patriots system.
Tom Brady will make them a hall of famer.
Someone pinch me. That fit is out of this world.
Is that a tailored suit? Because daaaaaamn that’d be a great fit. 
I might be on an island, but I think he’d be a great fit.
GREAT FUCKING FIT!
Hell ya! MAGA (Make America A Great Fit Again On The Patriots)
